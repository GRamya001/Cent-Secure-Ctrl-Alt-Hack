As we know that information is a crucial resource, and securing that info is more than necessary in our digital world. And considering the pandemic situation now, all the information is being transferred online, we would need a data hiding application to exchange information among individuals.
Steganography is used in secret communication between acknowledged parties, it relies on hiding messages in unsuspected multimedia data. The goal of steganography is to hide the communication content in a medium that is disguising the data, so that the existence of hidden messages can be concealed.
This application allows anyone to send secret messages hidden in an image, to others with utmost security . We are implementing LSB (least significant bit) technique, in consideration to security as well as image quality.
